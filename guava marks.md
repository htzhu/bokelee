# 瓜娃 Guava
---
Guava is the open-sourced version of Google's core Java libraries: the core utilities that Googlers use every day in their code. 

Guava has staggering numbers of unit tests: as of July 2012, the guava-tests package includes over 286,000 individual test cases. Most of these are automatically generated, not written by hand, but Guava's test coverage is extremely thorough, especially for `com.google.common.collect`.
